### **Contact the Research Technology Services team**

For Katana issues including: functional issues, software installation, reference data sets, general questions - 
email the [IT Service Centre](mailto:ITServiceCentre@unsw.edu.au), including the word **Katana** in the subject line.

!!! info
    This is the best and primary way to get help from UNSW Research Technology Services beyond this document. You *must* use your UNSW email address *or* your zID. Without this information, we have no idea who you might be.

    When writing your email, please include a clear and detailed description of the issue experienced, including error messages and node name. Something like "It doesn't work" doesn't help us help you! If at all possible, include the steps someone else needs to do to reproduce the problem, the job identifier, the date and time of your problem and on which Katana node it occurred, the script filename and the directory you were running from.

    **Example of a bad request**
        i'm trying to do some work on katana, but it seems that the server is slow or not responsive at times. i'm logged in from inside unsw today, so working from home shouldn't be the issue.
        
    **Example of a great request**
        When I tried to run Sentaurus TCAD today (2020-05-01) on Katana I got this error message regardless of structures I wanted to simulate:
            
        “Job failed
        Error: Child process with pid '116643' got the signal 'SIGSEGV' (segmentation violation)
        job exits with status 1”
        
        My job ran on k052 with jobid 300000, my zID is z2134567
