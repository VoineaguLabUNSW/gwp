# GWP Documentation

The new markdown syntax is very different, but allows more complex UI elements like content tabs.

The live branch is updated automatically on commit. The Material for MKDocs version has hence been pinned in ci.yml to prevent issues, but the overridden styles will most likely work with future versions.

```bash
# Testing
mkdocs serve
...
# Generate static
mkdocs build
```
